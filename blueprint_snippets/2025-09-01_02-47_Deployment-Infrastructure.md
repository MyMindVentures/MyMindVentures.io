## Deployment Architecture
Cloud-native deployment strategy:

### Primary Hosting
**Bolt Hosting Platform**
- **Automatic Deployment**: Seamless deployment from development environment
- **Build Optimization**: Optimized production builds with Vite
- **Static Asset Serving**: Efficient static asset delivery
- **Custom Domain Support**: Custom domain configuration capability

### Backend Infrastructure
**Supabase Backend-as-a-Service**
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed PostgreSQL with automatic backups
- **Edge Functions**: Serverless function deployment and scaling
- **Authentication**: Built-in authentication and user management
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Build & Deployment Process
Automated build and deployment pipeline:

### Build Configuration
- **Production Optimization**: Minification, tree shaking, and compression
- **Asset Processing**: Image optimization and static asset processing
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for performance
- **Bundle Analysis**: Build size analysis and optimization

### Deployment Pipeline
- **Automated Builds**: Triggered builds on code changes
- **Environment Management**: Separate development, staging, and production environments
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback to previous versions
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment health validation

## Infrastructure Monitoring
Comprehensive infrastructure monitoring:

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Time Tracking**: API and page load time monitoring
